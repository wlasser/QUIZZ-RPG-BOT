# QUIZZ-RPG-BOT
Somelike "framework" for manage quizz with VK/Facebook comunity/chat bots. Basic as game with RPG text-like mechanics and communication
OK. There is somelike "instruction".

For work with VK (vkAPI) you must config API KEYS and ACCESS with you app (community).
This one in config_vk_bot.php in root. Set all stuff.
This one more in /api/src/config.php
And last: index.php
What is problem now with it? Im being lazzy at sometime, and didn't proper to fix this stuff.

Next, you are must create database and import sql from framework/sql folder.

And finish it: check framework/classes for config.php and look over ConfigMgr.php in this folder.
Sorry for random ugly s*it, but have what i am have.

All codestyle, codefix, hackfix, features welcome.
